# MC-Log4J-Exploit-Checker
Checks your Minecraft logs folder to see if you've been affected by the recent Log4J exploit!  
You can now also check your Badlion & Lunar client logs if you're on Windows!  

## Usage

Compiled Jar and other files can be downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/Koupah/MC-Log4J-Exploit-Checker/releases)

### Windows
If on Windows you can run this two separate ways:  
Method 1: Downloading [LogChecker.exe](https://github.com/Koupah/MC-Log4J-Exploit-Checker/releases/download/0.3/LogChecker.exe) from [Releases](https://github.com/Koupah/MC-Log4J-Exploit-Checker/releases) and run it  

OR if you don't trust random `.exe` files, and you shouldn't, you can use Method 2.

Method 2: Download `LogChecker.jar` and `start.bat` from [Releases](https://github.com/Koupah/MC-Log4J-Exploit-Checker/releases), make sure they're both in the same folder, then run `start.bat`

### Mac/Linux
Mac/Linux users, I haven't tested this on either platform but, I added premade selections for both platforms as follows.  
`~/Library/Application Support/minecraft` Mac Default  
`~/.minecraft` Linux Default  
However, you're still able to input a custom directory after selecting either of these.

## Notes
   1. I put this together fairly quickly, if you have any suggestions or issues then please open an Issue on GitHub or contact me via Discord (Koupah#5129)
   2. The `LogChecker.exe` is just a wrapped Jar file, you still need Java to run it
   3. You do not have to run my jar file. I encourage you to look through the source and compile it yourself. It's all here.
   4. You may also run `LogChecker.jar` with an additional argument to specify your `.minecraft` folder location
