# MC-Log4J-Exploit-Checker
Checks your Minecraft logs folder to see if you've been infected by the recent Log4J exploit!

## Usage
If on Windows you can run this two separate ways:  
   1. Downloading [LogChecker.exe](https://github.com/Koupah/MC-Log4J-Exploit-Checker/releases/download/0.1/LogChecker.exe) from [Releases](https://github.com/Koupah/MC-Log4J-Exploit-Checker/releases) and run it
   2. Download `LogChecker.jar` and `start.bat` from [Releases](https://github.com/Koupah/MC-Log4J-Exploit-Checker/releases), make sure they're both in the same folder, then run `start.bat`

Mac/Linux users, I haven't tested this on either platform but, if you'd like to try using this then you can do the following:
Run `LogChecker.jar` with an additional argument for your `.minecraft` folder location
Example: `java -jar LogChecker.jar /home/minecraft`

Compiled Jar and other files can be downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/Koupah/MC-Log4J-Exploit-Checker/releases)

## Notes
   1. I put this together fairly quickly, if you have any suggestions or issues then please open an Issue on GitHub or contact me via Discord (Koupah#5129)
   2. The `LogChecker.exe` is just a wrapped Jar file, you still need Java to run it
   3. You do not have to run my jar file. I encourage you to look through the source and compile it yourself. It's all here.
