# MC-Log4J-Exploit-Checker
Checks your Minecraft logs folder (including zipped logs) to potentially see if you've been a victim of the recent Log4J exploit!  
You can now also check your MultiMC logs on all platforms alongside Badlion & Lunar client logs on Windows!  

See how to [use this](#usage), [capabilities](#capabilities) and more in this README.

**Please also read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) at the bottom of this README file.**

## Capabilities 

## What can this do?
This tool it capable of detecting if someone has attempted to use this exploit on you.  
This tool can go through your logs, and it **does** unzip any zipped (.gz) logs automatically in order to check them aswell.  
This tool is also able to tell you what files the exploit was detected in and tells you the lines that it detected the exploit on.

## What can't this do?
This tool can **not** determine for certain that you were not a victim of the exploit.  
This tool also can not determine, if any, what code was run by the exploit nor the severity of it.  

## So what is the purpose of this tool?
Just because this tool can not certainly tell you if you were affected, it can tell you if any attempts were made whether or not they were successful.  
This tool allows you to take action **now** instead of waiting for something bad to potentially happen.

## Usage

Compiled Jar and other files can be downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/Koupah/MC-Log4J-Exploit-Checker/releases)

### Windows
If on Windows you can run this two separate ways:  
Method 1: Downloading [LogChecker.exe](https://github.com/Koupah/MC-Log4J-Exploit-Checker/releases/download/0.41/LogChecker.exe) from [Releases](https://github.com/Koupah/MC-Log4J-Exploit-Checker/releases) and run it  

OR if you don't trust random `.exe` files, and you shouldn't, you can use Method 2.

Method 2: Download `LogChecker.jar` and `start.bat` from [Releases](https://github.com/Koupah/MC-Log4J-Exploit-Checker/releases), make sure they're both in the same folder, then run `start.bat`

### Mac/Linux
Mac/Linux users, I haven't tested this on either platform but, I added premade selections for both platforms as follows.  
`~/Library/Application Support/minecraft` Mac Default  
`~/.minecraft` Linux Default  
However, you're still able to input a custom directory after selecting either of these.

## Notes
   1. I put this together fairly quickly, if you have any suggestions or issues then please open an Issue on GitHub or contact me via Discord (Koupah#5129)
   2. The `LogChecker.exe` is just a wrapped Jar file, you still need Java to run it
   3. You do not have to run my jar file. I encourage you to look through the source and compile it yourself. It's all here.
   4. You may also run `LogChecker.jar` with an additional argument to specify your `.minecraft` folder location

## Disclaimer  
If there are no results it doesn't guarantee you were not affected as some attackers could have modified your logs.  
You have to remember that this is Minecraft, most attackers are more than likely script kiddies copy and pasting an exploit someone else has provided them. 
In a lot of cases they won't clear/modify your logs.  

If attempts at the exploit are found, it is your duty to investigate them and determine if they were successful, malicious, etc.  

I am not responsible for any actions you may or may not take after using my tool.  
It is not my responsibility if you rely solely upon this tool to determine if you were affected.
